## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Travel Planner Agentic AI
**Objective:**  
Demonstrate how a modular, agent-based AI system can assist users in planning travel itineraries by selecting destinations, flights, and hotels, and generating contextual travel tips.

**Approach:**  
Implement a multi-agent framework (Flight, Hotel, Travel Tips agents) coordinated by a simple orchestrator. Each agent focuses on a specific task, while prompts and sequences are optimized to work with lightweight, free models (`google/flan-t5-small`) in Google Colab.

**Learning Value:**  
- Understand the concept of Agentic AI and multi-agent orchestration.  
- Learn how to design modular AI workflows that collaborate sequentially.  
- Explore lightweight, free, and secure AI models for practical, hands-on experimentation.  
- Gain experience in building interactive interfaces and structuring AI projects for clear understanding.
