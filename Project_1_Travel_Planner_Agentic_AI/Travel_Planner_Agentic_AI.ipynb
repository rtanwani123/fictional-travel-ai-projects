        "# Project Title: Fictional Travel Co. - Travel Planner Agentic AI\n",
        "# ============================================================\n",
        "# OVERVIEW:\n",
        "# This is a lightweight, educational example of how to build a simple\n",
        "# multi-agent (Agentic AI) system using completely free and secure tools\n",
        "# in Google Colab.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# The scenario is based on a fictional company — \"Fictional Travel Co.\" —\n",
        "# which helps users plan trips to major cities.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# In this project, the system is divided into three simple AI agents:\n",
        "#   • Flight Agent  → Provides flight options\n",
        "#   • Hotel Agent   → Provides hotel options\n",
        "#   • Travel Tips Agent → Provides simple travel suggestions or activities\n",
        "#\n",
        "# The orchestrator function combines the outputs of these agents\n",
        "# to create a single, easy-to-read travel plan.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# WHY THIS PROJECT IS USEFUL:\n",
        "# - It demonstrates the modular design principle of Agentic AI\n",
        "# - It uses small, simple models (no paid APIs)\n",
        "# - It is lightweight enough to run on free Google Colab CPUs\n",
        "#\n",
        "# ============================================================\n",
        "# STEPS:\n",
        "# 1. Install and import required libraries\n",
        "# 2. Create dummy travel data and save as JSON files\n",
        "# 3. Build each agent (Flight, Hotel, Travel Tips)\n",
        "# 4. Build the orchestrator that coordinates the agents\n",
        "# 5. Create a user interface using Gradio\n",

        "# Step 1: Install Libraries\n",
        "# ============================================================\n",
